# Hachette UK API Javascript SDK

Hachette UK are currently in the progress of building a public API Gateway to our Bibliographic data. This will encompass resources like:

- ### *Products* (Which are predominately books).
- ### *People* (Contributors to our books, like our lovely Authors).
- ### *Events* (Example book signings)

Currently the API and this SDK is a very much work in progress (WIP), but please Star us if you wish to follow and keep up with where we are.

We also have a [.NET SDK](https://github.com/HachetteUK/huk-dotnet-sdk) available.

## UPDATE

**1st November 18**: Building the beta RESTful Client.
